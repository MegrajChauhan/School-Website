            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Our team .........., would like to thank sir Anil Raj Dahal, our computer teacher, for this golden
                oppurtunity to display our creativity and knowledge gained after learning about the scripting language
                known as HTML and CSS. We would also like to thank him for letting us use JavaScript, which is a higher
                level programming language, in this project to help make it better. We would also like to thank our dear
                sir for providing the images required for this project. This project has allowed us to apply what we
                have learned in class and gain practical experience in web development.We also want to thank our fellow
                classmates for their support and encouragement throughout this project.We are proud of the results we
                have achieved, and we hope that our project showcases our skills and dedication to this field.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a scripting language used for creating the basic
                structure of websites. Without HTML, the web as we know it today would not exist. CSS stands for
                Cascading Style Sheets and is another scripting language used for enhancing the visual appearance of a
                page created using HTML. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a high-level programming language that is
                widely used in web app development, mobile application development, and other areas. It is often used to
                make modern websites more dynamic.
                <br>
                While it's true that in the field of web development, HTML is sometimes called the "skeleton" of a
                website, CSS the "muscles and skin", and JavaScript the "brain", we found that this metaphor does not
                fully capture the complexity and interdependence of these three technologies. Nonetheless, we are
                grateful to have had the opportunity to apply what we've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this
                project, and we thank our computer teacher for introducing us to these powerful tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project consists of various pages, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>Home page</li>
                <li>About us page</li>
                <li>Contact us page</li>
                <li>Events page</li>
                <li>Gallery page</li>
                <li>Admission page</li>
                <li>Services page</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these pages has its own respective features and purpose. They are used to convey different messages
            to the audience. The home page gives a summarized information about the school, while the about us page
            provides comprehensive details. The contact us page serves as a medium to communicate with the consumers of
            the institution's services, while the admission page is used for registering individuals as potential
            students after taking the entrance examination. The website also includes a gallery page showcasing pictures
            of the institution, a services page summarizing the services provided by the institution, and an events page
            to display the upcoming, ongoing, and completed events of the school.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website uses additional materials such as icons and other images, which were obtained from the
                internet and not provided by our teacher. The website has a minimalist design due to time constraints,
                which prevented us from making it more dynamic and interesting. While the website fulfills the basic
                requirements of the project set by our teacher, it does not have any extraordinary features or elements
                that are found in most modern websites. The website is purely basic with a set of traditional features
                and techniques.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page-four box-shadow page">
            <h1>Scope: Limitations, Assumptions, Features and Our Helpers</h1>
            <p>
                This website doesn't assume an imaginary school; instead, it depicts our very own Panchayat Secondary
                School. As mentioned before, the website has a minimalist design due to time constraints. The website
                uses materials such as pictures, content, icons, etc., which were obtained from our own teacher, the
                internet, and research.
            </p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                The website has several limitations, including:
            <ol>
                <li>The website contains very little readable content.</li>
                <li>The website is not as dynamic as anticipated.</li>
                <li>The website uses some traditional techniques and ideas.</li>
                <li>The website has a bare-bones design.</li>
                <li>It contains some bugs caused by inappropriate JavaScript code.</li>
                <li>It is very simple.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Assumptions</h3>
            <p>
                During the creation of this website, the following assumptions were made:
            <ol>
                <li>Use of extra images and icons from the internet was allowed.</li>
                <li>The website can use concepts beyond what our teacher has taught us.</li>
                <li>The simple design will not affect our practical marks.</li>
                <li>The website does not require a backend.</li>
                <li>The website can or cannot be dynamic.</li>
                <li>Use of content not actually provided by the teacher, such as description paragraphs.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>
                Although the website is designed using simple and traditional techniques, it still has a few noticeable
                features. For instance, the home page features a bar slider that was created using CSS and JavaScript
                techniques. The services page also has an image slider for the hero section, but it has some bugs due to
                timing errors in JavaScript. However, the website lacks overall dynamism.
            </p>
            <h3>Websites that helped us</h3>
            <p>During the creation of the page, we took as much help as we needed from the following websites.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>: For the images</li>
                <li><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>: For proofreading of the written materials</li>
                <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>: For the fonts used all over the website</li>
                <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">Google Materials and Icons</a>: For the icons and materials
                    used</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>: For the research on school website designs</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>: For the images of our teachers and school</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago website</a>: For inspiration on the design
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="page-five box-shadow page">
            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>
                The website uses traditional techniques and ideas for the different features and aspects of the website,
                including the visual design. The most important aspect of the website was to learn and practice
                JavaScript programming language, which took up most of the time provided to us by the teacher, and
                compelled us to make the website simple and barebone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The home page has the most beautiful design among all of the pages, and it took us almost 3 days to
                complete it, which also contributed to the simplicity of the other pages. It contains a bar slider that
                slides from bottom to top after the website has been completely loaded by the browser. The bars include
                some education-related icons that provide the feeling of a school website. The bars are of different
                colors and heights.
            </p>
            <p>
                The about page was completed second, and is expected to provide all of the information needed for a
                consumer to know about the institution. However, it still lacks some points and items due to incomplete
                research caused by time constraints. It has nothing remarkable except for the "Our Ideal" section, which
                was inspired by the website of the University of Chicago.
            </p>
            <p>
                The services page has an image slider as the hero section. It uses the "Div content exchange technique"
                where two "Div" tags share and update their inner contents using JavaScript, giving the illusion of a
                slider. The events page, gallery page, admission page, and contact page have nothing remarkable.

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>The end result of our work is satisfactory, but we acknowledge that there is always room for improvement.
                In the future, we will strive to do better and complete projects within the given time limit. With this
                project, we have successfully created a website that showcases our skills and knowledge in HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript. Furthermore, we were able to learn more about our school and its history, which was an
                unexpected benefit of the project.</p>
            <p>We are proud of what we have accomplished and believe that the website accurately represents our school.
                However, we also recognize that there are areas for improvement and hope to continue refining our skills
                in web development. Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience for us and we look
                forward to applying what we have learned in future projects.</p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Through the process of creating this website, we have come to appreciate the power of JavaScript, HTML,
                and CSS in building beautiful and functional websites. It has been a humbling experience to realize that
                our creative abilities may not have been as strong as we initially believed, but this project has
                allowed us to grow and improve our skills.</p>
            <p>As we continue to learn and develop our web development skills, we look forward to creating even more
                impressive and dynamic websites that not only meet but exceed expectations.</p>
